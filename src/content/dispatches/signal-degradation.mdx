## Transmission Log: October 2025

We've been monitoring the same forums for seventeen years. The signal-to-noise ratio follows a predictable curve, but something changed in Q3 2024. The usual patterns of degradation accelerated.

### Observed Phenomena

**Phase 1: Initial Contact**
- Community forms around shared purpose
- Signal clarity: 87%
- Meaningful exchange rate: High

**Phase 2: Growth Period**
- Influx of new participants
- Signal clarity: 64%
- First signs of semantic drift

**Phase 3: The Eternal September**
- Continuous onboarding without cultural transmission
- Signal clarity: 23%
- Original meaning becomes archaeological artifact

### Field Notes

What's particularly interesting is the *speed* at which this happens now. Communities that would have taken 8-10 years to complete the cycle in the early 2000s now run through it in 18-24 months.

The patterns are consistent:
1. In-jokes become ritual without meaning
2. FAQs go unread, answered questions return
3. Veteran members depart silently
4. The community continues, a ship of Theseus made of strangers

### Archival Status

This dispatch documents a pattern we've seen repeat across platforms, technologies, and generations. The medium changes. The decay rate changes. The pattern persists.

*End transmission.*
