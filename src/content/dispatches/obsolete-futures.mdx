## Archive Entry #047

There's a peculiar category of artifact that exists only in promotional materials and trade show demos. The future that was sold but never shipped.

### Case Study: The Living Room Computer (1979-1985)

Before the PC won, there was a brief window where the future of computing might have been something else entirely. Wood-paneled terminals designed to match your furniture. Computers marketed as home appliances, sitting next to the TV like a microwave oven.

**The Vision:**
- Family gathered around the terminal
- Recipe databases instead of recipe cards
- Home banking (via 300 baud modem)
- "Computer literacy" as a parlor skill

**What Actually Happened:**
The IBM PC arrived in beige corporate boxes. Computing became work-adjacent. The living room computer became a gaming console, which became smartphones, which became... well, we're still watching that unfold.

### The Aesthetic of Abandoned Futures

What fascinates us at OPOD is not just that these futures didn't happen, but that they left aesthetic traces. The wood paneling. The earth tones. The assumption that technology should blend into domestic space rather than dominate it.

Somewhere in a parallel timeline, computing took the path of televisionâ€”a piece of furniture, a domestic appliance. In our timeline, we got office equipment that infected homes.

### Pattern Recognition

Every few years, someone rediscovers this aesthetic and tries to make "warm" technology again. It never quite works. The context is gone. You can't resurrect a future that failed to arrive.

But we can document it. We can remember what tomorrow was supposed to look like from 1982.
