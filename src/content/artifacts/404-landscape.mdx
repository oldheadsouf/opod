A landscape composed entirely of dead links.

This piece aggregates 404 error pages from websites that no longer exist. Each "pixel" is a thumbnail of a different 404 page—some custom-designed, some generic server errors, some elaborate illustrations, some just text on white backgrounds.

**Collection methodology:**
- Archive.org Wayback Machine scraping
- Personal bookmark graveyards (links saved 10-15 years ago)
- Deleted social media profile pages
- Discontinued product pages
- Abandoned web projects

**Patterns observed:**
- Early 2000s: Playful, creative 404 pages (animated GIFs, jokes)
- Mid 2010s: Branded, corporate 404 pages (search suggestions, navigation)
- Late 2010s: Minimalist 404 pages (just the number, maybe a button)
- 2020s: Generic server errors (sites too dead for custom pages)

The image resolves into something resembling a landscape—a digital graveyard rendered in broken links and error messages. Mountains of 404s, valleys of dead domains, rivers of redirect loops.

When you zoom into the full-resolution version (link above), you can read individual error messages. Some are poetic in their simplicity:

"Page not found."
"This page has been removed."
"Error 404: The requested resource is no longer available."
"Nothing here."

Each one is a tiny epitaph for a piece of web content that someone created, hosted, and eventually abandoned.

The web is impermanence made visible. Links rot. Domains expire. Content disappears. The 404 is the web's tombstone.

This piece documents that decay.
