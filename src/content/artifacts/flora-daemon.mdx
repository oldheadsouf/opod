This piece layers screenshots from defunct terminal emulators (Terminator, rxvt, iTerm 1.x) with fragments of deprecated command outputs and error messages that no longer appear in modern systems.

The green phosphor glow comes from CRT terminal simulation filters applied to LCD screenshotsâ€”a simulation of a simulation, twice removed from the original hardware.

Each layer represents a different era of terminal computing:
- Layer 1: VT100 era (1978-1985)
- Layer 2: X Terminal era (1989-1995)
- Layer 3: Early GUI terminal emulators (1995-2005)
- Layer 4: Modern terminal emulators simulating retro aesthetics

The text fragments are actual error messages, command prompts, and system outputs preserved from machines long since decomissioned. ASCII art signatures from long-gone sysadmins. Login banners from servers that no longer exist.

This is archaeology of the command line. Every generation of terminal users believes they're getting "closer to the machine" than their GUI-using contemporaries. Every generation is equally distant from the actual hardware, mediated by layers of abstraction that just look different.

The ghosts in the terminal are us, reflected back through decades of emulation.
