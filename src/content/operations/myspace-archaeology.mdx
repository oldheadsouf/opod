## Operation Status: Ongoing

**Mission Brief:**
Systematic documentation and preservation of MySpace-era web design aesthetics, autoplay music choices, and profile customization patterns from 2003-2008.

### Methodology

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition**
- Archive.org Wayback Machine scraping
- Community archives from former users
- Interview subjects who "peaked" on MySpace
- Recovered profile screenshots from ancient hard drives

**Phase 2: Pattern Analysis**
- Cataloging Top 8 selection strategies
- Mapping aesthetic evolution of profile backgrounds
- Documenting the autoplay song as identity marker
- Analyzing custom HTML/CSS as folk art

**Phase 3: Cultural Context**
- What did profile customization mean before platforms became sterile?
- The death of personal web space aesthetics
- How MySpace's decline predicted the sanitization of online identity

### Key Findings

**The Maximalist Aesthetic:**
MySpace profiles were *loud*. Animated GIFs, clashing colors, autoplay music videos, sparkle cursors. This wasn't accidental—it was intentional self-expression in a way that modern social media explicitly prevents.

**HTML as Vernacular:**
Teenagers learned HTML to customize their profiles. Copy-pasting code snippets from profile generator sites became a form of folk craft. When was the last time a social platform taught its users to code?

**The Top 8 as Social Technology:**
Your Top 8 friends wasn't just a list—it was a public declaration of social hierarchy, subject to constant negotiation and drama. Modern platforms hide or flatten these dynamics. MySpace made them explicit and agonizing.

### Archival Artifacts

- 2,847 profile screenshots cataloged
- 423 autoplay songs identified and preserved
- 156 custom profile themes reconstructed
- 89 oral history interviews conducted

### Implications

MySpace wasn't just a platform that died. It represented a brief window when social media allowed genuine aesthetic chaos and personal expression. Every platform since has moved toward:
- Standardized templates
- Limited customization
- Clean, marketable aesthetics
- Algorithmic content over personal curation

The MySpace aesthetic is extinct not because it was bad, but because it was unmarketable.

### Next Steps

- Complete oral history archive
- Create interactive museum of preserved profiles
- Document the autoplay music canon
- Publish findings on aesthetic standardization

**Operation continues. Documentation never ends.**
