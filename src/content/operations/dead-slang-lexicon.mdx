## Operation Overview

**Objective:** Catalog internet slang terms that had brief lifespans in specific online communities but never achieved widespread recognition before dying out completely.

### Collection Criteria

Terms must meet ALL of the following:
1. Originated online (not borrowed from offline usage)
2. Had active use period of 6-36 months
3. Confined to specific communities/platforms
4. Died without mainstream dictionary recognition
5. No longer understood by current users of origin communities

### Sample Entries

**"Sauce/Based" Precursors (2009-2011)**
Before "sauce" meant source and "based" became a compliment, there were proto-versions of these terms that emerged and died in various forums. We're tracking at least 7 different early variants that competed for adoption.

**Tumblr Linguistic Fossils (2012-2014)**
Tumblr's specific formatting quirks created slang that only worked in that context. When Tumblr changed its interface or users migrated, these terms died completely. Examples include shorthand that relied on specific reblog formatting.

**Forum-Specific Linguistic Innovation (2005-2015)**
Every major forum developed internal slang. Most of it died with the forums. SomethingAwful, various subreddits, early Discord serversâ€”each created and lost entire vocabularies.

### Methodology

**Data Sources:**
- Archived forum posts and comments
- Screenshot collections from defunct communities
- Interviews with "old heads" who remember
- Linguistic analysis of usage patterns pre-death

**Documentation Process:**
1. Identify potential dead slang through archive diving
2. Verify usage period through dated posts
3. Confirm death through modern community surveys
4. Document etymology and usage context
5. Catalog in permanent archive

### Findings

**Pattern: Slang Death Modes**

1. **Platform Death:** Slang dies because the platform dies (RIP Vine slang)
2. **Mainstream Corruption:** Term gets adopted by normies, original users abandon it
3. **Context Collapse:** Term required specific cultural context that no longer exists
4. **Replacement:** Better term emerges and completely supplants the old one
5. **Cringe Death:** Community collectively decides term is embarrassing

### Cultural Significance

Language change happens faster online than offline. We can watch slang evolve and die in months instead of decades. These dead terms are:

- Archaeological evidence of extinct online cultures
- Proof of linguistic innovation happening in real-time
- Markers of community boundaries that no longer exist

### Archival Status

- **Terms cataloged:** 1,247
- **Communities documented:** 83
- **Active use periods mapped:** 1,247
- **Etymology chains traced:** 402
- **Interviews conducted:** 156

### Future Work

- Create searchable database of dead slang
- Map linguistic family trees
- Track rare cases of "zombie slang" revival
- Document the process of slang death in real-time

**The language keeps changing. The archive keeps growing.**
